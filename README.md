Repository for my Year 12 CS Mastermind Project

There are 3 wworking versions
* v1: Basic game
* v1.1: Adds a main menu and local save/load game functionality
* v2: Adds a score (linked to the number of rows used and the time taken), and created an account and global leaderboard system

The Client GUI is written in Pygame and KivyMD. 

You can see the remote backend server repo (implemented using Flask and MongoDB) [here](https://github.com/tjfacos/mastermind_server_flask)
